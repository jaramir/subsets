Range Grouping Kata
===================

Write a function that groups ranges of integers based on them having common values

Example
-------

Given these ranges:
    a = 1..3
    b = 2..5
    c = 8..9
    d = 7..9

The function shall return two groups:
    G = a, b
    H = c, d

Adding the range 
    e = 4..7 

Should change the result to a single group
    I = a, b, c, d, e
